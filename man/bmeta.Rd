Specifying the data

The function can be used to evaluate odds ratios (or log odds ratios), mean difference 
and incidence rate ratios (or log incidence rate ratios). Users need to specify a list 
of data to be used in the function. For binary data, events out of case and control arm 
and sample size of case and control arm need to be listed. For continuous data, mean 
and standard errors of case and control arm need to be listed if information is 
available. However, if only mean difference and variance can be retrieved from each 
study, users need to list mean difference and precision (inverse of variance). Notice 
that information of all the studies need to be provided in the same format for the 
function to work properly. For example, the function cannot work if some of the studies 
provide mean and standard errors of the two arms while the rest studies provide mean 
difference and variance. For count data, total number of events in the follow-up period 
of case and control arm, total follow-up person-time in case and control arm should 
be listed. 

If additional impacts of a variable or more than one variable are observed (when 
meta-regression is expected to be used), users need to provide a matrix with each column 
either containing a dummy variable or a continuous variable. In case that categorical 
variables (i.e. ethnicity, age band) are observed and included, users need to first 
choose a 'baseline' category as reference and then create dummies for each of the rest 
categories.

Model selection

Apart from 'null' models which apply Bayesian methods to obtain study-specific without 
pooling-effects, there are 22 models included in this package for pooling study-specific 
estimates together and producing summary estimate. The number of models designed for 
binary, continuous and count data are 8, 8 and 6, respectively. The model selection 
process for binary and count data requires users to specify not only whether 
meta-analysis or meta-regression is wanted but also the priors to be used. 

For binary data, normal and Student t-distribution priors for summary estimates (on log 
scale) can be selected and it is indicated that Student t-distribution has heavier tails 
and is therefore more robust to outliers. The argument 'model' here includes 4 options
--- \code{std.norm}, \code{std.dt}, \code{reg.norm}, \code{reg.dt}.

For continuous data, rather than specifying prior, users need to select whether all 
studies included report mean and standard errors of two arms separately or only mean 
difference and variance as discussed above in the 'Specifying the data' section. The 
argument 'model' here includes 4 options--- \code{std.ta}, \code{std.mv}, \code{reg.ta}, 
\code{reg.mv} ('model' ending with 'ta' represents 'two arms' and ending with 'mv' 
represents 'mean and variance'). 


For count data, uniform and half-Cauchy distribution priors for the variability of 
summary estimates (on log scale) can be selected. It is suggested that half-Cauchy 
distribution has heavier tails and allows for outliers and accommodates small variances 
closing to zero. It should be noticed that there is no need to specify priors for 
fixed-effects models for count data. The argument 'model' here includes 6 options
--- \code{std}, \code{std.unif}, \code{std.hc}, \code{reg}, \code{reg.unif}, 
\code{reg.hc}.

In conjunction with the argument 'type'--- \code{fix} or \code{ran}, users can select 
the specific model wanted for a certain type of data.
